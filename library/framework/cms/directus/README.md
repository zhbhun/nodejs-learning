> Directus is an Open Data Platform built to democratize the database. Its no-code app is safe and intuitive enough to make data accessible to everyone, while still providing the granular configuration and technical tools required by power-users and data scientists. For developers, a data connection toolkit provides a dynamic REST+GraphQL API, JavaScript SDK, and options for authorization, caching, and more.
